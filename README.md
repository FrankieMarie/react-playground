# React Playground

This is a fullstack repo where I try things for fun and experiment with tools I am interested in.
I have built a basic TODO app to demonstrate CRUD actions and show design patterns in React.
Both front and backend utilize [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/)
